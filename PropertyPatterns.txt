# This is the file for defining the syntax of the blpEditor application

# Lines starting with # are considered comments and not parsed
# Each line is written like (without the # at start of line):
# ID # content, content1|content2, namespace:content::

# content is a static string. The user will be unable to Change it

# content1 | content2 is parsed as a drop-down. The user will choose 
# one of the options that are separated by the "|" (pipe) character

# Namespace:content:: exampleContent is parsed as a text field. The type is content. 
# It can be prefilled with exampleContent (if it exists), or be empty.
# The user will be able to edit the value of exampleContent

# DO NOT USE DASHES IN PROPERTY IDS! DON'T DO RBLP-P1a, USE ':' INSTEAD, LIKE IN RBLP:P1a

# Syntax should always be first so that parsing for the complex items can work
# Any complex item (e.g <Time-Interval>) referenced in the content a line of syntax should first be defined
# Always put the simplest form of a definition first, since it will be the default
