# This file is used for controlling what the application recognizes as Prep Words. 
# Prep words are commonly used words that have no ontology backing, 
# such as for, in, and etc

# These words will be recognized in the text regardless of capitalization
# If a word happens to be both a prep word and an instance, the application
# will highlight it as an instance

# Comments can be entered by starting a line with a '#' (without the quotes)
